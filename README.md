# Maze
Generate and solve mazes on the Python terminal. 
Uses a recursive maze generation algorithm and has two maze solving algorithms. 
The two maze solving algorithms are depth first search and breadth first search. 
Depth first search simply finds a path from the start to the end. 
Breadth first search takes more steps, but will show the best path. 
Only need to run the "maze_solver.py" file to generate and solve mazes.
